## Safe Work Procedure
### Definitions
1. Teach Pendant Emergency Stop Button means the Red button located on the teach pendent attached to the Robot Arm.
2. Table Emergency Stop Button means the red button located on the front left corner of the table near the PC screen display.
3. Freedrive Button means the push button located on the back of the teach pendent.
4. Robot Arm Power Icon means the circular icon located at the bottom left corner on the teach pendent screen. To turn ON the power to the robot, first click on this button (which shows up in RED when power to the arm is disabled), and then click ON icon on the screen. When the Robot boots up to Robot Idle position, press the START icon. To turn OFF the Robot click the OFF button. 
5. Virtual Safety Plane means a virtual plane created with the aid of the teach pendent. Whenever the robot tool or the elbow touches this virtual plane, the robot would come to an abrupt stop. Virtula safety planes ensure that no part of the Robot lies outside the predefined operational envelope.

### Start Up and Operation
1. All users should wear enclosed shoes inside the lab. Long hair should be tied back. No loose jewellery or clothing allowed.
2. Ensure the wheels attached to the robot table are locked.
3. Ensure the Robot Control Box has access to power by switching ON the power point on the wall. The instructor/supervisor will then use a 'power key' to enable power to the control box. Robot can not be turned ON without the 'power key'.
4. Ensure the area around the robot table is not congested.
5. Make sure that no unnecessary items are placed on the table inside the robot working envelope.
6. Undock the teach pendent from the Robot Control Box and securely hold-on to the teach pendent by using the strap attached to the back of the teach pendent
7. Ensure Both Emergeny stops are released.
8. Press the Power button located next to the Teach Pendant Emergency Stop button. Allow 10-20 seconds for system boot-up. If the system doesn't power-up, it may mean that the power to the control-box is cut-off using a key-switch which is located on the control-box. 
9. Ensure that the INSTALLATION setting is set to default
10. Once the safety settings are checked, the user can enable power to the Robot Arm
11. Keep clear of the Robot Arm work envelope before enabling power.
12. Users are not allowed to erase any program on the teach pendent (which are not created by them)
13. Stop the execution of any program running on the teach pendent.
14. Ensure the Robot Arm is returned to Home position.
